## Blurb

In this practical session, we will be exploring how transcriptomics, specifically RNA-seq can be used to study phenotypic plasticity in non-model organisms. Our research group studies how the phenotype and development of amphibian tadpoles is influenced by different environmental factors, including predator presence, changes in hydroperiod and background colour. In today's workshop we will look at the gene expression underlying the curious ability of Western Spadefoot toad tadpoles to adjust their pigmentation to match their background.

We will start with a quick slideshow introducing the system and the general concept of RNAseq. We will then make sure we are all up to speed on how to use R and the `tidyverse`, by analysing the the phenotypes of tadpoles reared on dark and white backgrounds. The tidyverse is a great tool that will make working with -omics data much easier and for a much more in detail tutorial, I suggest [this R book](https://bookdown.org/ansellbr/WEHI_tidyR_course_book/) by Brendan Ansell.


We will then working through the data obtained from an RNAseq experiment to learn about what gene pathways are underlying changes in pigmentation. Given the short time available, this will be a very quick overview and for expert tutorials and workflows I recommend [this tutorial](http://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/vignettes/DESeq2/inst/doc/DESeq2.html) by the creator of `DeSeq2`.
